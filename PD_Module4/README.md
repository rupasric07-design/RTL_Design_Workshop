# Module Structure

This module is divided into four major sections:

1. **Timing Modeling Using Delay Tables**
2. **Timing Analysis with Ideal Clocks**
3. **Clock Tree Synthesis and Signal Integrity**
4. **Timing Analysis with Real Clocks**

---

# 1️ SKY130_D4_SK1 — Timing Modelling Using Delay Tables

This section introduces the relationship between **standard-cell physical information and timing information**.

A standard cell needs more than its logical function. Physical design tools also require information about:

* Cell dimensions
* Pin locations
* Routing tracks
* Input capacitance
* Output load
* Cell delay
* Transition time
* Timing arcs

These characteristics are represented through **LEF and Liberty timing libraries**.

---

## Lab 1 — Convert Grid Information to Track Information

### `svgSKY_L1`

This lab explains how physical layout grid information is converted into **routing-track information**.

### Concepts Covered

* Layout grid
* Manufacturing grid
* Routing tracks
* Track pitch
* Metal routing
* Track alignment
* Standard-cell placement compatibility

### Why It Matters

Physical design tools use routing tracks to determine where wires can be placed.

Correct track information ensures that:

* Cells align correctly.
* Pins can connect to routing tracks.
* Standard cells can be placed consistently.
* Routing tools can access cell pins.

---

## Lab 2 — Convert Magic Layout to Standard Cell LEF

### `SKY_L2`

This lab demonstrates how a physical standard-cell layout created in Magic is converted into a **LEF (Library Exchange Format)** representation.

### LEF Contains

* Cell dimensions
* Cell name
* Pin information
* Pin direction
* Pin layer
* Pin geometry
* Power and ground pins
* Obstructions
* Routing information

### Layout → LEF Flow

```text

```

### Why LEF Is Important

LEF provides an abstract physical representation of a standard cell without exposing all transistor-level layout details.

Placement and routing tools use LEF information to understand how cells can be physically placed and connected.

---

## Lab 3 — Timing Libraries and Including a New Cell in Synthesis

### `SKY_L3`

This lab introduces **timing libraries** and explains how a new standard cell can be incorporated into the synthesis flow.

A Liberty timing library contains information such as:

* Cell function
* Timing arcs
* Input capacitance
* Output transition
* Cell delay
* Setup time
* Hold time
* Power information
* Operating conditions

### Typical Flow

```text

```

Adding a custom cell allows the synthesis tool to use that cell during technology mapping and optimization.

---

#  Lab 4 — Introduction to Delay Tables

### `SKY_L4`

This lab introduces the concept of **delay tables** used in standard-cell timing characterization.

Cell delay is not a fixed value.

It changes depending on parameters such as:

* Input transition
* Output capacitance
* Load
* Operating conditions

Therefore, timing libraries use lookup tables to represent cell delay and transition behavior.

### Basic Concept

```text
Input Transition
        +
Output Load
        ↓
   Delay Table
        ↓
   Cell Delay
```

---

#  Lab 5 — Delay Table Usage — Part 1

### `SKY_L5`

This lab focuses on the practical use of delay tables.

The timing engine determines cell delay by using the relevant combination of:

* Input slew
* Output capacitance

The corresponding value is obtained from the characterized timing table.

---

#  Lab 6 — Delay Table Usage — Part 2

### `SKY_L6`

This lab continues the analysis of delay-table behavior.

It demonstrates how changing:

* Input transition
* Output load
* Cell characteristics

affects the resulting delay.

This provides the foundation for understanding how STA engines calculate path delay.

---

#  Lab 7 — Configure Synthesis to Fix Slack and Include `vsdinv`

### `SKY_L7`

This lab focuses on configuring synthesis settings to improve timing slack and include the custom **`vsdinv`** inverter cell.

### Key Concepts

* Synthesis constraints
* Timing optimization
* Slack
* Cell selection
* Custom standard-cell integration
* Timing-driven synthesis

### Slack

Slack represents the timing margin available on a path.

```text
Slack = Required Time − Arrival Time
```

Interpretation:

* **Positive slack** → timing requirement is met.
* **Zero slack** → path is exactly at the timing limit.
* **Negative slack** → timing violation exists.

# 2️  SKY130_D4_SK2 — Timing Analysis with Ideal Clocks Using OpenSTA

This section introduces **Static Timing Analysis using ideal clocks**.

Before building a physical clock tree, clock arrival is initially treated as idealized.

This allows the design's basic timing behavior to be analyzed independently of physical clock-tree effects.

---

#  Lab 1 — Setup Timing Analysis & Flip-Flop Setup Time

### `svgSKY_L1`

This lab introduces **setup timing analysis**.

### Setup Time

Setup time is the minimum amount of time that data must remain stable **before the active clock edge** of a flip-flop.

A simplified timing relationship is:

```text
Data Launch
     ↓
Combinational Logic
     ↓
Data Arrival
     ↓
Setup Requirement
     ↓
Capture Clock Edge
```

If data arrives too late, a **setup violation** occurs.

---

#  Lab 2 — Clock Jitter and Uncertainty

### `SKY_L2`

Real clocks are not perfectly periodic.

Clock behavior can be affected by:

* Jitter
* Variation
* Noise
* Clock uncertainty

### Clock Jitter

Clock jitter represents variation in the timing of clock edges from their ideal positions.

### Clock Uncertainty

Clock uncertainty provides a timing margin to account for clock variations and uncertainty.

Conceptually:

```text
Ideal Clock Edge
       ↓
Clock Variation
       ↓
Timing Uncertainty
       ↓
Reduced Timing Margin
```

---

#  Lab 3 — Configure OpenSTA for Post-Synthesis Timing Analysis

### `SKY_L3`

This lab demonstrates how to configure **OpenSTA** for timing analysis after synthesis.

Typical inputs include:

* Gate-level netlist
* Liberty timing library
* SDC constraints
* Clock definition
* Input/output constraints

### OpenSTA Flow

```text

```

---

#  Lab 4 — Optimize Synthesis to Reduce Setup Violations

### `SKY_L4`

This lab focuses on improving timing by modifying synthesis settings.

Possible optimization mechanisms include:

* Cell sizing
* Buffer insertion
* Logic optimization
* Cell selection
* Timing constraints
* Fanout optimization

The goal is to reduce negative setup slack and improve the timing margin.

---

#  Lab 5 — Basic Timing ECO

### `SKY_L5`

ECO stands for **Engineering Change Order**.

A timing ECO makes targeted modifications to an existing design instead of completely rebuilding the design.

Typical timing ECO operations can include:

* Cell replacement
* Buffer insertion
* Cell sizing
* Logic modification

The objective is to correct timing problems while minimizing unnecessary changes.

#  3️ SKY130_D4_SK3 — Clock Tree Synthesis & Signal Integrity

This section introduces **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**.

A clock signal must reach many sequential elements with controlled:

* Delay
* Skew
* Transition
* Fanout
* Signal integrity

A good clock distribution network is therefore essential for reliable synchronous operation.

---

#  Lab 1 — Clock Tree Routing and Buffering Using H-Tree

### `svgSKY_L1`

An **H-Tree** is a balanced clock distribution structure.

The clock is progressively divided into branches so that different endpoints can receive approximately balanced clock paths.

```text
                 CLK
                  │
             ─────┼─────
            │           │
         ───┼───     ───┼───
        │       │   │       │
       FF      FF  FF      FF
```

### Main Objective

The purpose of balanced clock distribution is to reduce differences in clock arrival time, commonly referred to as **clock skew**.

---

#  Lab 2 — Crosstalk and Clock Net Shielding

### `SKY_L2`

Clock signals are particularly sensitive to unwanted coupling from nearby signal wires.

### Crosstalk

Crosstalk occurs when electrical coupling between neighboring wires causes unwanted effects on a signal.

For clock networks, this can affect:

* Clock delay
* Clock transition
* Clock skew
* Timing margins

### Clock Shielding

Shielding places a suitable fixed-potential wire near a sensitive clock wire to reduce coupling from neighboring signal nets.

Conceptually:

```text
Signal | Shield | Clock | Shield | Signal
```

The objective is to protect the clock network from unwanted capacitive coupling.

---

#  Lab 3 — Run CTS Using TritonCTS

### `SKY_L3`

This lab demonstrates the execution of **Clock Tree Synthesis using TritonCTS**.

CTS introduces clock buffers and routing structures to distribute the clock to sequential elements.

### CTS Flow

```text
Clock Source
     ↓
Clock Tree Synthesis
     ↓
Buffer Insertion
     ↓
Clock Distribution
     ↓

     ↓

```

The CTS process considers factors such as:

* Clock fanout
* Buffer selection
* Clock delay
* Clock skew
* Transition
* Physical location of sinks

---

# Lab 4 — Verify CTS Runs

### `SKY_L4`

After CTS, the generated clock tree must be verified.

Important parameters include:

* Clock skew
* Clock latency
* Clock transition
* Buffer count
* Clock fanout
* Timing impact
* Clock routing

The CTS result must be checked before proceeding to further physical-design stages.

#  4️ SKY130_D4_SK4 — Timing Analysis with Real Clocks Using OpenSTA

This section introduces timing analysis after the clock tree has been physically implemented.

Unlike ideal-clock analysis, real-clock analysis considers the actual clock distribution network.

```text

     ↓
CTS
     ↓
Clock Buffers + Routing
     ↓
Real Clock Arrival Times
     ↓
Real-Clock STA
```

---

#  Lab 1 — Setup Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks

### `svgSKY_L1`

This lab analyzes setup timing after CTS.

The analysis now includes actual clock propagation through the clock tree.

Factors include:

* Clock insertion delay
* Clock skew
* Data path delay
* Setup requirement
* Clock uncertainty

Real-clock STA therefore provides a more physical representation of timing than ideal-clock STA.

---

#  Lab 2 — Hold Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks

### `SKY_L2`

This lab introduces hold timing analysis with propagated clocks.

### Hold Time

Hold time is the minimum duration for which data must remain stable **after the active clock edge**.

A hold violation occurs when data reaches the capture flip-flop too early.

Conceptually:

```text
Capture Clock Edge
       ↓
Hold Window
       ↓
Data Must Remain Stable
```

Hold analysis becomes especially important after CTS because clock skew can change the relative arrival time of launch and capture clocks.

---

#  Lab 3 — Analyze Real-Clock Timing Using OpenSTA

### `SKY_L3`

This lab demonstrates how to analyze timing after CTS using OpenSTA.

The analysis includes:

* Propagated clocks
* Clock tree delays
* Setup timing
* Hold timing
* Clock skew
* Timing slack

The resulting reports provide a more realistic representation of post-CTS timing behavior.

---

#  Lab 4 — Execute OpenSTA with Correct Timing Libraries and CTS Assignment

### `SKY_L4`

This lab focuses on correctly configuring OpenSTA after CTS.

Important inputs include:

* Correct Liberty timing libraries
* Gate-level netlist
* SDC constraints
* CTS-generated clock information
* Clock assignments
* Propagated-clock configuration

Using the correct timing library and clock configuration is essential for obtaining meaningful STA results.

---

#  Lab 5 — Impact of Larger CTS Buffers on Setup and Hold Timing

### `SKY_L5`

This lab investigates how increasing the size of CTS buffers affects timing.

Larger buffers can change:

* Clock transition
* Clock delay
* Clock latency
* Clock skew
* Setup slack
* Hold slack
* Power consumption

The important point is that changing clock-buffer size can affect **both setup and hold timing**, sometimes in different directions.

Therefore, CTS optimization requires considering the complete timing picture rather than optimizing only one metric.

#  Why Clock Tree Quality Matters

In a synchronous digital circuit, many flip-flops depend on the same clock.

If the clock reaches different flip-flops at significantly different times, the available timing margin can change.

Therefore, clock-tree design must consider:

* Balanced clock distribution
* Controlled skew
* Acceptable clock latency
* Good transition
* Controlled fanout
* Signal integrity
* Setup timing
* Hold timing

#  Conclusion

SKY130 Module 4 provided hands-on understanding of **pre-layout timing analysis, timing modeling, Static Timing Analysis (STA), Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), and real-clock timing analysis**.

The module progressed from **standard-cell LEF and timing-library preparation** to **delay-table analysis**, followed by **ideal-clock STA using OpenSTA**. Setup timing, clock jitter, clock uncertainty, synthesis optimization, and timing ECO techniques were studied to understand and improve timing performance.

The module then introduced **Clock Tree Synthesis using TritonCTS**, including clock buffering, H-Tree concepts, clock skew, crosstalk, shielding, and CTS verification. Finally, **real-clock setup and hold analysis** was performed using OpenSTA to understand the impact of the physical clock network on overall timing.

Overall, this module demonstrated how **standard-cell timing, synthesis, clock distribution, and physical implementation are closely connected in achieving timing closure** and provided a strong foundation for advanced physical-design and RTL-to-GDSII workflows.
